I would like to use the OpenXMLViewer.exe from a java application (ie not .NET environment).&nbsp; With this in mind</p>\r\n<p>1. Are there any system requirements for using OpenXMLViewer.exe ...and</p>\r\n<p>2. Are there any extra installation steps required ?</p>\r\n<p>Thank You</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The VC90 runtimes are present in the zip package, which will be referred to, when OpenXMLViewer.exe is invoked.</p>\r\n<p>The only depenancy is that the executable be run from the Openxmlviewer folder containing the dependent dlls, or the PATH variable contains the OpenXMLViewer folder path.</p>\r\n<p>Eg. If OpenXMLViewer_win_cmd.zip is extracted to c:\\OpenXMLViewer folder, then the exe has to be run from c:\\OpenXMLViewer</p>\r\n<p>or</p>\r\n<p>c:\\OpenXMLViewer should be present in the PATH environment variable.</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Anand</p>",
