    "Html": "Hi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It is possible to use the translation on the server side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe .cs codebase is available as is, since we are working with the C++ port for the translator. The serverside scenario can be done using the commandline application as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commandline application takes in the input file and the output directory, and generates the xhtml file. This can be used to render documents as HTML on the server side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are in the process of enhancing the server side support using the commandline application. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatch this site for updates shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest regards,<br>\r\nAnand\r\n",
