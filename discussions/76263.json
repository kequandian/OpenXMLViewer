From looking at other threads here I know there is no default support for it but I am trying to make an &lt;xsl:template=&quot;customPageBreak&quot;&gt; that I can call each time the text overflows onto the next page.</p>\r\n<p>I know I can inject a tag into the &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;w:br&quot;&gt; and the tag shows on the output html but this only happens when a page break is forced in the original document. Also I have created a &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;w:lastRenderedPageBreak&quot;&gt; which injects my custom html tag before the documents last page so now I want to call my customPageBreak template every time the text flows over onto a new page.</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas how I can calculate when the text is due to overflow or any suggestions as to how I might edit the DocX2Html.xslt to calculate it, what variables should I be looking at in there? Is it enough to look for footers or can a document without a footer be missed like that?</p>\r\n<p>Can I look for the w:t element or use the pgSz attribute to calculate it? Any help appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
