<h1>Overview</h1>
 The Office Open XML format specification has been approved as a free and open <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">Ecma International standard</a>. A newer improved version is approved as an  <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=45374">ISO/IEC standard</a>. <br /><br />The OpenXML Document Viewer project is an outcome of the feedback from participants of a series of <a href="http://www.documentinteropinitiative.org/recentevents.aspx">Document Interoperability Initiative workshops</a>. The main goal of the OpenXML Document Viewer project is to create software tools, plus guidance, showing how documents created using Open XML Format can be translated to HTML. As a result,  Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), Solutions Integrators &amp; Mobile Solution providers can use these tools to enable their customers view Open XML documents on heterogeneous platforms and browser applications. The OpenXML Viewer is available under the open source Microsoft Public License (MS-PL), which allows anyone to use the tools, submit bugs and feedback, or contribute to the project. We have chosen to use an Open Source development model that allows developers from all around the world to participate and contribute to the project. <br /><br />For a video demo of the latest release, please see the post titled <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/interoperability/archive/2009/05/17/openxml-document-viewer-v1-released-viewing-docx-files-as-html.aspx">OpenXML Document Viewer v1 released: viewing .DOCX</a> on the Microsoft Interoperability Team Blog. <br /><br />We encourage you to view video demonstrations of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el-3TKVgX-0">translation engine</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSF6w0EK0s">FireFox browser plug-ins</a> on YouTube.<br />
